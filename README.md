# bank-statement-convertor
<br>Converting my own bank statement into a tabular (CSV) format so that I can analyse my own spending habits, mainly just how much I am spending every month, week, day and more. Just a personal project for myself to keep track of my own spending habits. 

<br>Steps to get started:

<br>Install the virtual environment first. 
    <br>- Open CMD in the project folder and type python -m venv env
    <br>- In CMD then type the following cd "env\Scripts\activate"
    <br>- Once activated change the interpretor path to the virtaul environment interpretor 
    <br>- In CMD go back to the directory with main.py and requirements.txt and then install the dependencies from requirements.txt by
        typing the following in the cmd (install -r ./requirements.txt)
    <br>- Everything should be installed now and you will be able to run the program
